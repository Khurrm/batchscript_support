## Project Context and Information
Back in the days when I was working for IT support, then at that time I have written many scripts to make my life easier. This script is one among many of them. 

## Getting Started
These are the simple bash commands.  You can simply download this code from Github and make sure to save the file with Windows Batch File (.bat) format. 

### Prerequisites
Windows OS
Specific Admin rigths.

Some familiarity with the Bash scritpting
Appropriate permissions to execute the commands. 
### Installing

You don't need to install anything as Bash scripting is a part of CMD.If you have a Windows machine then everything is alright. 

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the script

Just click on the script after saving it in the appropriate folder and it will work.
